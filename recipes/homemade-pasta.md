# Homemade Pasta  

## ingredients
* 3 large eggs  
* 2 cups all-purpose flour (or 50/50 blend with semolina flour)  
* 1 tbsp olive oil  
* 1 tsp kosher salt  

## steps

easy way:  
1. mix everything in a bowl, mix with hands until a shaggy dough forms  

harder, but more legit way:
1. place flour in a wide pile on the counter, make a small indentation in the middle – **this must be big enough to contain all the wet ingredients or you will have a huge mess!**  
2. crack the eggs into the indentation, add the oil and salt  
3. stir vigorously with a fork, slowly letting bits of the flour tumble into the egg  
4. using a bench scraper, fold the flour over the egg mix repeatedly until dough starts to form  

knead and rest:  
1. knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes  
2. cover very tighly with plastic wrap and let rest at least 30 minutes  

roll, cut, and cook:  
1. when ready, dust work surface with flour  
2. roll out dough, fold in thirds, rotate 90º and roll again; repeat at least 5 times to laminate dough  
3. roll out until very thin  
4. if making fettucine or similar noodles, lightly roll and slice  
5. unravel noodles, toss with flour to avoid sticking  
6. cook in salted boiling water 90–120 seconds  

## notes  
* 30 minutes rest **at least**, but more will probably be better!
