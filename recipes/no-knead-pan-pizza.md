# No-Knead Pan Pizza

## ingredients
* 400 grams (about 2.5 cups) bread flour  
* 10 grams kosher salt  
* 4 grams instant yeast  
* 275 grams water  
* 8 grams extra-virgin olive oil  
* Homemade pizza sauce  
* Low-moisture mozarella cheese  
* Toppings of your choice!

## steps
1. Combine flour, salt, yeast, water, and oil in a large bowl (at least 4–6 times the volume of the dough)  
2. Mix with hands until no dry flour remains  
3. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, then let rest at cool room temp (no warmer than 75ºF) for 8–24 hours; dough will rise dramatically and fill the bowl  
4. Sprinkle top of dough lightly with flour, then transfer to a well-floured surface  
5. Divide dough into two pieces and form into a tight ball  
6. Pour 1–2 tbsp oil in the bottom of a 10" cast iron skillet  
7. Place one ball of dough in each pan and turn to coat evenly with oil  
8. Using a flat palm, press dough around the pan, spreading to fill the bottom to the edges of the pan  
9. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let dough sit at room temp for 2 hours  
10. After the first hour, adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 550ºF  
11. After two hours, dough should fill pan up to the edges; use your fingertips to press it until it fills in every corner (pop large bubbles); lift all edges of the dough to let air bubbles escape  
12. Top dough with 3/4-cup sauce, cheese, and toppings  
13. Bake until top is golden brown, 12–15 minutes (if bottom is not dark brown, place pan on a stove burner and cook 2–3 minutes longer)  

## notes  
* Dough requires 8–24 hour first rise and another 2-hour rise before baking!
