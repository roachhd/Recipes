# Tiny Teddy Racers
Cute, edible "cars" for kid's parties—fun to assemble and eat.

## info
* Makes: ~12 racers
* No-cook; some melting required

## ingredients
* 100g cooking chocolate, melted
* 1 bag Milky Way bars
* 1 box Tiny Teddy biscuits, honey flavour
* 1 bag Smarties (340g)

## steps
1. Set out a tray or serving plate for the racers.
2. Sort Smarties by color. Cut 12 Smarties in half for "steering wheels."
3. Unwrap Milky Ways. Cut 24 Tiny Teddies in half across the belly if needed.
4. Put melted chocolate in a resealable bag; snip a small corner.
5. Attach 4 Smarties as "wheels" to each Milky Way "car" using a tiny drop of chocolate. Place on the tray.
6. Use a drop of chocolate to set a Teddy upright atop each car.
7. Glue on a Smartie "steering wheel" with chocolate in front of each Teddy.

## notes
* Use matching Smartie colors for a stylish look.
* No need to cut Teddies—slit the Milky Ways instead.
* Fun-size bars can substitute for Milky Ways.
