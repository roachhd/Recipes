# Pita Bread  

## ingredients  
* 8 oz water, 105–115ºF  
* 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil  
* 1 tbsp granulated sugar  
* 2.25 tsp (one packet) instant yeast  
* 1 tsp kosher salt  
* 2.5 oz whole wheat flour  
* 10 oz all-purpose flour  

## steps
1. In a stand mixer or bread machine, add all ingredients and knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 15–20 minutes  
2. Leave sitting, covered, in a warm place for one hour  
3. Punch down dough and cut into 8 pieces (6 if you want really big pitas); roll them into a ball, cover with a damp towel, and let rest for 10 minutes  
4. Roll each dough into a thin circle (no more than 1/4" thick); place on a floured surface and cover with a damp towel for 30 minutes until slightly puffy  
5. Heat a cast iron pan over high heat, with just a little oil  
6. Cook pitas one at a time, flipping when slightly charred
