# Tic Toc Tea Cups
A sweet, no-bake treat that looks just like tiny teacupsâ€”great for sharing at parties.

## ingredients
* 1 pkt (250g) Arnott's Tic Toc biscuits
* 1 pkt (250g) marshmallows (4 flavours)
* 1 pkt (200g) Allen's Freckles
* 1 pkt (34g) Lifesavers Musk, halved
* 100g white chocolate, melted

## steps
1. Lay out Tic Toc biscuits on a serving platter.
2. Use melted chocolate to "glue" a marshmallow in the center of each biscuit.
3. Add a drop of chocolate to the top of each marshmallow, then add a Freckle to each.
4. Use a dot of chocolate on the cut surface of each Lifesaver half; stick to the side of the marshmallow for a cup handle.

## notes
* If out of chocolate, use a paste of icing sugar with a little water to stick everything together.
