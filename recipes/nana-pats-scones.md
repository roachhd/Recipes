Soft and fluffy scones, perfect served warm with jam and cream.

## info  
* Prep time: 15 mins  
* Cook time: 25 mins  
* Servings: Approx. 16  

## ingredients  
* 3 cups self-raising flour  
* 80g Lurpak slightly salted butter, chilled and cubed  
* 1–1¼ cups milk  
* Pinch of salt  
* Plain flour, for dusting  
* Sugar, jam, and whipped cream, to serve  

## steps  
1. Preheat oven to 200°C. Sift self-raising flour into a large bowl.  
2. Rub butter into flour with fingertips until mixture resembles breadcrumbs.  
3. Make a well in the centre, add 1 cup milk, and mix with a flat-bladed knife until a soft dough forms. Use a little more milk if needed.  
4. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead gently until smooth (avoid over-kneading).  
5. Dust a baking tray with plain flour. Pat dough into a 2cm-thick round and cut into 5cm rounds.  
6. Re-shape unused dough as needed to get ~16 rounds. Place on tray 1cm apart.  
7. Lightly dust tops with plain flour. Bake 20–25 mins or until golden and risen.  
8. Transfer to a wire rack. Serve warm with jam and cream.  

## notes  
* Handle the dough as little as possible to keep scones light and fluffy.  
* These are perfect fresh, but can be reheated gently the next day.
